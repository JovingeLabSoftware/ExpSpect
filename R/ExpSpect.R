#' ExpSpect: A package for gene-expression based 'spectrometry'
#'
#' The ExpSpect package facilitates deconvolution of gene expression 
#' data to identify perturbations related to specific gene pathways
#' or druggable targets.  Used in the context of gene expression 
#' profiling of cells treated with some unknown material of interest
#' (e.g. serum from patients with unknown environmental exposures), 
#' such analysis is analagous to tandem mass spec proteomics--excpet 
#' that rather than a spectrometer, gene expression is used together 
#' with libraries of expression signatures (such as LINCS) to 
#' deconvolute the composition of the material.
#' 
#' We are in no way affiliated with the LINCS project.  This package
#' does not provide LINCS data, which can only be obtained with 
#' permission from the LINCS project.  Once you have access, downloading the data is straightforward
#' (and illustrated in a soon to be release vignette for this package).
#' While not providing the data, this package \strong{does} provide 
#' tools that greatly facilitate working with these large data files
