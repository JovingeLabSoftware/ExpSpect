## Overview of Approach

We leverage the excellent work of the [`rocker-org`](https://github.com/rocker-org) team. 

Developers will need to be on a machine with sufficient storage space (>120 GB) and have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) installed.


## AWS Configuration

AWS has proven to be the easiest platform for working with LINCS data.

Starting on a fresh Ubuntu spot instance with attached storage instance (we usually use 200 GB EBS). 

The following commands were adopted from the [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html) and show the basic workflow of mounting an attached EBS volume to `/data/` on our working instance. 

```
# see if we need to create file system + create it
sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

# create mount point and mount
sudo mkdir /data
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data

# install docker
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

# run our container in daemon mode
sudo docker run -d --name rstudio -v /data:/data rocker/rstudio
```
